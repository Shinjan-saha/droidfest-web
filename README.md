## Design System
This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the visual elements that define our brand's identity, ensuring consistency across all digital and print mediums. Below, you'll find detailed information on our color palette, typography, and usage guidelines.
This design system ensures that our content is accessible, engaging, and visually consistent across all platforms. 

### Colors
Our color system is designed to be vibrant yet cohesive, reflecting our brand's dynamic and innovative spirit. Here's a breakdown of our color categories:

#### Color System: Primary
- Blue: Used for primary actions, links, and highlights. 
- Dark: For backgrounds and text, providing a strong contrast for readability.
- Light: For light backgrounds and subtle UI elements.

#### Color System: Accents
- Purple: Adds vibrancy and draws attention to secondary actions.
- Red: Used for warnings or alerts.

#### Color System: Tertiary
Includes custom KUG Kolkata shades for varied visual interest and depth:
- Lightened Purple
- Accented Magenta
- Dark Purple
- Plum
- Yellow
and more.

#### Color System: Gradients
- Linear Gradient: Transitions smoothly between primary and accent colors, used for dynamic backgrounds.
- Mesh Gradient: Offers a more complex gradient effect, ideal for large banners or hero sections.

Typography
Our typography is chosen to balance readability with aesthetic appeal, ensuring that our textual content not only communicates effectively but also visually aligns with our brand's ethos. Here's how we utilize different font sizes and weights to create a clear visual hierarchy and emphasis across our materials:
- Display Fonts: These are the largest and most prominent text styles, used for major headlines or titles where we want to grab attention or convey a significant message. The bold weight of these fonts ensures they stand out and dominate the visual space they occupy.
- Headings: Slightly smaller than display fonts but still significant, headings are used to introduce new sections or topics. They help in organizing content and guiding the reader through different layers of information, from main topics down to subtopics. The use of bold weights here maintains readability at a glance.
- Subtext and Body Text: These are the workhorses of our text styles, used for the bulk of our written content. The regular weight is generally used for body text, ensuring it's easy to read over longer stretches of text. Subtext, often used in headings or as secondary information, uses a lighter weight to subtly differentiate it from the main text without losing its connection to the content.
- Specialized Fonts: For technical details or specifications, we employ fonts like Roboto Mono, which is designed for clarity and precision in technical documents. This font helps in distinguishing code or data from regular text, making it easier for readers to focus on these elements.
- Small Text: Used for footnotes, captions, or any less critical information, small text in lighter weights ensures that this information is readable but does not compete with more important content for attention.

By varying font sizes and weights, we create a dynamic yet coherent visual hierarchy that enhances user experience by making navigation through content intuitive and engaging. This system not only supports the functional aspect of reading but also contributes to the overall aesthetic that reflects our brand's identity.
